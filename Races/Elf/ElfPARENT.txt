{1}-Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception Skill.-[Perception]
:F:-{1}-Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic cannot put you to sleep.-@Being charmed@
:F:-{1}-Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After Resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
{1}-Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.-;Elvish;-;Common;
:C:-{1}-Subrace. You must choose a subrace from the following choices: Drow, Eladrin, High Elf, Mark of Shadow, Pallid Elf, Sea Elf, Shadar-kai, or Wood Elf.
