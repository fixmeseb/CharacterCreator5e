Hello, and welcome to the markdown legend! I'm completely making up the markdown format as I go, so I figured I might as well let you know how I do it!
Races:

{LEVEL}: Indictates the level that a feature is unlocked at.
:C:- Indictates a choice to be made, such as feature or skill. Generally one or more of the trailing tags will be listed as ANY, indictating the choice to be made. The alternative is a "/" which indictates the options to be choosen from.
:F:- Indictates a feature that must be listed on the character sheet. These are generally the features that affect role playing or some non-numbers crunching item.
:CF:- Indictates both :C: and :F:. 
Ability Score Increases: <SCORE,INCREASEAMOUNT,QUANTITY>. Score is the score to be increased, increase amount is the amount to be increased by. QUANTITY is an optional quantity for the number of ability scores increased. The SCORE value must be ANY and the QUANTITY values must all be different.
