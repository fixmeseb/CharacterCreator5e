:F:-{1}-Some Abridged Notes About SpellCasting: You can prepare a number of spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level, with a minumum of one spell. The spell must be a level at which you can cast. To cast a spell, it must be prepared (excluding cantrips). You can change your list of spells after a long rest.

Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and youi can cast each of them once at third level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
